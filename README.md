# Text-to-Speech (TTS) with Transformer trained on LJSpeech

This repository provides all the necessary tools for Text-to-Speech (TTS)  with SpeechBrain using a [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08895.pdf) pretrained on [LJSpeech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/).

The pre-trained model takes in input a short text and produces a spectrogram in output. One can get the final waveform by applying a vocoder (e.g., HiFIGAN) on top of the generated spectrogram.


## Install SpeechBrain

```
pip install speechbrain
```
### Perform Text-to-Speech (TTS) - Running Inference
To run model inference pull the interface directory as shown in the cell below

Note: Run on T4-GPU for faster inference
```
!pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir gdown
!gdown 1oy8Y5zwkLel7diA63GNCD-6cfoBV4tq7
!unzip inference.zip
```
```python
%%capture
!pip install speechbrain
%cd inference
```

```python
import torchaudio
from TTSModel import TTSModel
from IPython.display import Audio
from speechbrain.inference.vocoders import HIFIGAN

texts = ["This is a sample text for synthesis."]

model_source_path = "/content/inference"
# Intialize TTS (Transformer) and Vocoder (HiFIGAN)
my_tts_model = TTSModel.from_hparams(source=model_source_path)
hifi_gan = HIFIGAN.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/tts-hifigan-ljspeech", savedir="tmpdir_vocoder")

# Running the TTS
mel_output = my_tts_model.encode_text(texts)

# Running Vocoder (spectrogram-to-waveform)
waveforms = hifi_gan.decode_batch(mel_output)

# Save the waverform
torchaudio.save('example_TTS.wav',waveforms.squeeze(1), 22050)
print("Saved the audio file!")
```

If you want to generate multiple sentences in one-shot, pass the sentences as items in a list.


### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

Note: For Training the model please visit this TTS_Training_Inference notebook

For the inference API, please visit the huggingface interface at (https://huggingface.co/Krisshvamsi/TTS)

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
